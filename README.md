# üçì Raspberry Pi Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

As part of my work in CNIT 17600 (Information Technology Architectures), I developed a fully functional IDS on a Raspberry Pi to detect early-stage reconnaissance traffic‚Äîsuch as ICMP pings and TCP SYN scans‚Äîcommonly used by attackers to map networks.

## üîç What It Does

| Feature                            | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| üì° Packet Sniffing                | Uses Scapy to capture network packets in real time                         |
| üõ°Ô∏è Threat Detection               | Detects ICMP Echo Requests and TCP SYN packets (reconnaissance attempts)   |
| üìù Logging                        | Alerts are written to both the terminal and a local log file               |
| ‚öôÔ∏è Protocol Support              | Supports ICMP, TCP (SYN flags)                                             |
| üß™ Validation                     | Tested using tshark, nmap, ping, and hping3                                |
